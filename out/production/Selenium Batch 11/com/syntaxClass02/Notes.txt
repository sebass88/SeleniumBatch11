Webdriver -->Its an interface

Steps to open chrome using selenium
1.Set System Properties (key,value)
key is the driver that we are using
value is the path to that driver
IF THE PATH IS INCORRECT WHAT WILL HAPPEN??
the driver executable doesnt exist

2.create an object of chromedriver()
3.use method .get() and pass the url of the website that you want to launch


--difference in quit()-->quits the whole browser vs close()-->is going to quit the current tab
--navigate() vs get() -->using navigate method we can move forward , backwards and refresh but not with get

--fullscreen() and maximixe() --> methods can be used to maximixe the window or show full screen


----------HTML--------------
<html>
	<body>
		<input name="moazzam"> (name is attribute ,moazzam is value of the attribute)
	</body>
</html>


the webpage has an underlying html code
--everything that we see on the webpage is basically appearing to us through some kind of code
DOM-->Document Object Model

WebElement:
everything that appears on the webpage is called a webelement


Locator:
it is the address or the position of the WebElement on the page

8 locators:
1.id
2.Name
3.Tagname
4.classname
5.linktext
6.partiallinktext
7.xpath
8.css

a webelement have an underlying code
this html code starts with a tag
the tag may have different attributes
these attributes are there to help locate those elements
and in some cases define the other criterias


--We must make sure that the locator that we are opting for
is unique enough
what if there are two same attribute with same values
--selenium is going to return us the first one

ID is the safest and most quick locator used

Why do we need so many locators?
--If the locator is not unqiue we can choose the one that is unique
--the devlopers may not provide us with all the locators

When do we get a noElement Exception?
Selnium was unable to find the element that we are looking for
GO CHECK YOUR LOCTAOR / ATTRIBUTE VALUE

<a> is called anchor tag ,it contain link
we can acces this using locator  "linktext or partiallink"
