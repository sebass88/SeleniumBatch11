========================= Selenium Class 06==========================

What is a drop down?

1. single select--> one option

2.multiple select--> more than one


Two Methods to handle drop downs:
 1. Click on the drop down and the select the option.

 2. Use select class
    Condition:
    <select> tag is there in the drop down

   Select class is a clas available to us in selenium which has
   different methods that help us to handle the drop downs

   Steps to use select class :
   1. to find the webElement dropdown having the select class
   2. Create an object of select class(webElement(which has the select tag))
   3.Use any method provided by select class to select the option you desire
        a. Byvalue()--> parameters the value attribute  "value in <options>" tag
        b. Byindex()--> parameter the index of the option that you want to select
        c. ByvisibleText()-->  parameter the text in the tag <option> which we want to select

   4. .getOptions()--> no parameter returns us all the tags <options> which are child of <select tag>
   return type is List<WebElements>

   Multiple Select Drop down

   1. isMultiple()---> if the drop down is multiselect or not

   addtional methods:

   a.deselectbyIndex()
   b.deselectebyValue()
   c.deselectbyVisibleText()
   d.deselectall()
   exception :
   No such element exception--> the webelement you are looking for is not there on the page


   Alerts:
   a pop-up message, it takes the focus completely off the page
   we cannot proceed in selenium until it is handled

   3 Types of Alerts:
        1.Web based alerts--> it is an html based alert/we can resolve them simply by inspecting

        2.Javascript alerts/browser alerts --> we can handle them by inspecting ? No (because they don't have html),we
        using switchTo method in Selenium

        3.Windows based alerts: Cannot be handle with Selenium


        Javascript Alerts:
        3 types:
          1. simple Alert----> click ok
          2. confirmation Alert-----> either cancel or ok
          3. Promp Alert----> enter text and cancel or ok


          HOW TO HANDLE THESE JAVASCRIPT ALERTS IN SELENIUM
            USING "alert interface"

            the methods it gives us"
                1.accept()
                2.dismiss()
                3.getText()
                4.sendKeys()
