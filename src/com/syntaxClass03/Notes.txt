What are locators?

******XPATH*******
Why do we need Xpath Locators?
--Developers may not have provided other locators in the html
by using Xpath we can identify those web elements easily.

What is an Xpath?
XPath is just like query language that help you to identify elements.

Types of Xpath's:
1.Absolute Xpath
--> Starts with a starting node in html
--> it starts with a single slash (/)
/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/form/div[2]/button

2.Relative Xpath
Syntax:
--> //tagname[@attribute='value']
example:
//input[@
hey can you find me the tag input who has attribute "type" with
the attribute value"password"


Identify the element by its Text:
//tagname[text()'text value']
hey can you find me the tag  which has text of value  'text value'
example: //a[text()='Alerts & Modals']


Identify elements using contains method
//tagname[contains(@attribute,'value')]
