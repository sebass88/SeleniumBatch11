There are 3 ways to interact with frames:
1) by index
2) by name or ID--> driver.switchTo().frame (String ID or name)
3) by webelement--> driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement)--> pass in the webelement

Default content()=== switching the focus back to the main page

In alerts--> no need to switch back focus
in frames--> we have to switch our focus back to home page
