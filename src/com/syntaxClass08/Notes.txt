WindowHandles():
unique ID associated with each new window or tab

How do we handle multiple wimdows in Selenium?

1. getallwindowHandles()--> gets all the handles--> return type== set of String
2. driver.switchTo.windows(desired windowHandle)


== Real work place  will == only 1 window or tab at a time


***********WAITS***************

1. Implicit Wait:
implicit wait is applied to all driver.findElement
if the element is found then no wait is applied
if is not found then the wai is applied   for a certain amount of time
*if the certain amount of time has passed and still the element we get an Exception
        "NoSuchElement"

       Syntax for this wait:
       driver.manage().timeouts.().implicitwait(time,units)
       implicitwait(maximum amount of time before it throws an exception, units)

       ----Implicit wait--> waits till the webElement is found


       2. Explicit Wait or webdriver waits
       these waits are used to tell the webdriver to wait till the certain condition is matched
